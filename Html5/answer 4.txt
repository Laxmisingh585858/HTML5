Use Semantic HTMl Elements:
 Using semantic HTML elements helps improve accessibility by providing meaningful structure to your content. Semantic elements like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, and <footer> etc.


Use Color with Care:
 Color plays an important role in web design, but it should not be the only means of conveying information. Ensure that color is not the sole indicator of meaning. For example, when using error
messages, pair color with text that explains the error. 

Provide Alt Text for Images:
Adding descriptive alt text to images using the alt attribute ensures that users who
cannot see the images can understand their content and purpose.
